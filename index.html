            A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images, typically composed of many pages (made of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) bound together and protected by a cover.
             The technical term for this physical arrangement is codex (plural, codices).
              In the history of hand-held physical supports for extended written compositions or records, the codex replaces its immediate predecessor, the scroll.
             A single sheet in a codex is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page.

                        Mystery fiction is a genre of fiction usually involving a mysterious death or a crime to be solved.
                         Often with a closed circle of suspects, each suspect is usually provided with a credible motive and a reasonable opportunity for committing the crime.
                          The central character will often be a detective (like Sherlock Holmes and his assistant John H. Watson) who eventually solves the mystery by logical deduction from facts presented...

                        Libraries are increasingly recognizing and using the categories of inspirational writing and inspirational fiction.
                         In the larger category of "inspirational writing," there are some books that easily and obviously fit, such as the Chicken Soup for the Soul series, clearly written
                          for the purpose of providing anecdotes that provide inspiration to the readers.
                          Inspiration fiction is fiction that focuses on religious values;it provides readers with content that is non offensive and ...

                        "Science fiction" is difficult to define precisely, as it includes a wide range of concepts and themes.
                         American science fiction and fantasy writer James Blish wrote: "Wells used the term originally to cover what we would today call "hard" science fiction, in which a
                          conscientious attempt to be faithful to already known facts (as of the date of writing) was the
                          substrate on which the story was to be built, and if the story was also ...

                        A biography, or simply bio, is a detailed description of a person's life.
                         It involves more than just the basic facts like education, work, relationships, and death; it portrays a person's experience of these life events.
                          Unlike a profile or curriculum vitae , a biography presents a subject's life story, highlighting various aspects of his or her life, including intimate details of experience,
                           and may include an...
